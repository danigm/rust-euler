//! Problem 6
//! Sum square difference
//!
//! The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
//! 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
//!
//! The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
//! (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
//!
//! Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
//! natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
//!
//! Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
//! natural numbers and the square of the sum.
